# Nintendont Forwarder for Priiloader
Go directly from power-on to Nintendont by autobooting Nintendont through this forwarder.

You can't autoboot Nintendont from Priiloader out of the box, unfortunately.
I'm not quite sure why this is, but it is.
So slap this forwarder in your `apps/` folder and set Priiloader to autoboot it instead.
It forwards to `apps/Nintendont/boot.dol`, which should be where you installed Nintendont.

If you do it right your SD card should have this folder structure:
```
SD
  apps
    forwarder
      boot.dol
      meta.xml
    Nintendont
      boot.dol
      icon.png
      meta.xml
```

I extracted this `.dol` out of Badablek's forwarder WAD, listed on the [GBAtemp Nintendont page](https://gbatemp.net/threads/nintendont.349258/).
